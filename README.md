Fatback Generator
=================

[Use The Fatback Generator](http://somecallmejosh.github.io/fatback-generator) to construct new grooves over randomly selected songs.

This is a web app that was born out of a need to practice a seemingly infinite number of variations of what **Gary Chaffee** calls **Fatback Grooves**. These are duple meter grooves, in 4/4 time with the snare on 2 and 4. There are 29 cymbal patterns (hi-hat and ride) and 22 interchangeable one-beat bass drum and snare drum patterns. 

There's not enough time to practice every combination, so I built this generator to take on the task of randomizing patterns that I may never consider on my own. I strongly urge you to [purchase Chaffee's book](http://www.amazon.com/Time-Functioning-Patterns-Book-CD/dp/0769234771/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1447286821&sr=8-1&keywords=Gary+Chaffee), especially if you find yourself using the Fatback Generator.

## Groove Essentials by Tommy Igoe

Groove essentials is another fantastic resource I use in my practice sessions. The goal of this series is to teach drummers different types of world grooves. The great thing is that it comes along with excellent audio tracks. I've included them as another layer of randomness to this generator. Each of the fatback combinations is accomanied by a randomly selected audio track from the Groove Essentials collection that challenges to play the patterns in a musical setting. The idea is to try hard to make the pattern work, regardless of the musical style. Here's an opportunity to get really creative.

## Please Consider the Authors of the above materials

**I had no part in the creation of the Groove Essentials and Time Functioning Patterns books. I benefit in no way by inlucding and/or referencing them in this app.** With that being said, it's safe to assume that lots of hard work was put in to these books and recordings by Tommy Igoe (and that group of amazing musicians) and Gary Chaffee. This is a tool that was inspired by these works and aids in my progress through the material. If you find yourself using this Fatback Generator App to work on the same material, please purchase the associated books and audio. Below are links to purchase them on Amazon, but feel free to buy them from wherever works best for you.
